# Search Algorithms Implementation

## The 12 search algorithms implemented in this repository are:

1. British Museum Search
2. Depth-first Search                   
3. Breadth-first Search
4. Hill-climbing Search
5. Beam Search
6. ORACLE
7. Branch and Bound
8. Dead Horse Principle (B&B with Exteded List)
9. B&B with Cost + Heuristics
10. A* (B&B with Cost + Heuristics + Dead Horse Principle) 
11. AO*
12. Best First Search

# Details:
- The above mentioned 12 algorithms have been implemented with a twist to visually distinguish the properties of each search algorithm. 
- All of the algorithms in this repository are implemented with python.
- First we generate a maze using DFS and recursive backtracking algorithm.
- Then each of the algorithms solve the maze which is visualized using matplotlib.
